Building a simple bank application using Angular for the front-end and Java (with Spring Boot) for the back-end is a great project to develop your skills. Here's a plan to guide you through the process, tailored for a beginner:

### **1. Define the Project Scope**
   - **Features to Include**:
     - User authentication (login/register).
     - View account details (balance, transaction history).
     - Transfer funds between accounts.
     - Deposit and withdraw money.
     - Admin panel to manage users and accounts.

### **2. Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - **Install Tools**:
     - **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
     - **Spring Boot**: Use Spring Initializr to bootstrap your Spring Boot project.
     - **Node.js and npm**: For running Angular and managing packages.
     - **Angular CLI**: Install using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
     - **IDE**: Use IntelliJ IDEA for Java and Visual Studio Code for Angular.

### **3. Design the Application Architecture**
   - **Back-End**:
     - Use **Spring Boot** for developing RESTful APIs.
     - Use **Spring Security** for handling user authentication and authorization.
     - Use **JPA/Hibernate** with **MySQL** (or any other relational database) for data persistence.
     - Define entities like `User`, `Account`, `Transaction`.
     - Create services to handle business logic and repositories for database operations.

   - **Front-End**:
     - Use **Angular** for creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
     - Create components like `LoginComponent`, `DashboardComponent`, `TransferComponent`, `TransactionHistoryComponent`.
     - Use **Angular Services** to communicate with the back-end API.
     - Implement routing for navigation between different views.

### **4. Build the Back-End (Spring Boot)**
   - **Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project**:
     - Use Spring Initializr to generate a new Spring Boot project with dependencies like Web, JPA, MySQL, and Spring Security.
   
   - **Step 2: Set Up Database**:
     - Configure your application to connect to a MySQL database in `application.properties`.
   
   - **Step 3: Create Models/Entities**:
     - Define your models (e.g., `User`, `Account`, `Transaction`) with JPA annotations.
   
   - **Step 4: Implement Repositories and Services**:
     - Create repository interfaces and service classes to handle data access and business logic.
   
   - **Step 5: Develop RESTful APIs**:
     - Create controllers to expose endpoints like `/api/accounts`, `/api/transactions`.
   
   - **Step 6: Implement Security**:
     - Use Spring Security to manage user authentication and authorization.

### **5. Build the Front-End (Angular)**
   - **Step 1: Create an Angular Project**:
     - Use Angular CLI to generate a new Angular project.
   
   - **Step 2: Set Up Routing**:
     - Configure Angular routing to manage navigation between pages.
   
   - **Step 3: Build Components**:
     - Create components for each part of your application (login, dashboard, transfer funds, etc.).
   
   - **Step 4: Create Services for API Communication**:
     - Create Angular services to make HTTP requests to your Spring Boot API using `HttpClient`.
   
   - **Step 5: Implement Forms and Validation**:
     - Use Angular’s Reactive Forms for creating and validating forms (e.g., login, transfer funds).
   
   - **Step 6: Integrate with Back-End**:
     - Connect your Angular application to the Spring Boot API to fetch and display data.

### **6. Testing**
   - **Unit Testing**:
     - Write unit tests for your Spring Boot services and controllers using JUnit.
     - Use Jasmine and Karma for testing Angular components and services.
   
   - **Integration Testing**:
     - Test the complete flow of data between the front-end and back-end.

### **7. Deployment**
   - **Back-End**:
     - Package your Spring Boot application as a JAR file and deploy it on a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   
   - **Front-End**:
     - Build your Angular project using `ng build` and deploy it to a web server (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Hosting).

### **8. Maintenance and Improvement**
   - Add more features like account statements, notifications, or mobile responsiveness.
   - Refactor your code to improve efficiency and readability.

This plan will help you get started with your banking application, guiding you from setting up your environment to deploying your finished application.


Integrating Storybook into your Angular project is a great way to develop, document, and test UI components in isolation. Here’s how you can add Storybook to your project, build new components, and then publish and use them in your Angular application.

### **1. Setting Up Storybook in Your Angular Project**
1. **Install Storybook**:
   - In your Angular project, run the following command to install Storybook:
     ```bash
     npx storybook init
     ```
   - This will set up Storybook for Angular, adding the necessary configuration files and dependencies.

2. **Run Storybook**:
   - Once installed, you can start Storybook by running:
     ```bash
     npm run storybook
     ```
   - Storybook should open in your browser at `http://localhost:6006/`, showing a default set of stories.

### **2. Creating and Writing Stories for Components**
1. **Create a New Angular Component**:
   - In your Angular project, create a new component using Angular CLI:
     ```bash
     ng generate component MyButton
     ```
   
2. **Add a Story for the Component**:
   - In the `src/app/my-button` directory, create a new file `my-button.stories.ts`:
     ```typescript
     import { Meta, Story } from '@storybook/angular';
     import { MyButtonComponent } from './my-button.component';

     export default {
       title: 'MyButton',
       component: MyButtonComponent,
     } as Meta;

     const Template: Story<MyButtonComponent> = (args: MyButtonComponent) => ({
       component: MyButtonComponent,
       props: args,
     });

     export const Primary = Template.bind({});
     Primary.args = {
       label: 'Primary Button',
     };
     ```

   - This story defines how the `MyButton` component will appear in Storybook.

3. **Customize the Story**:
   - You can add different variations of the component by creating more stories, like `Secondary` or `Disabled` versions of the button.

### **3. Publishing Your Components**
1. **Build Your Component Library**:
   - If your components are part of a shared library, you can build that library to be published as an npm package.
   - In Angular, create a library:
     ```bash
     ng generate library my-library
     ```
   - Move your components to the library, and build it:
     ```bash
     ng build my-library
     ```

2. **Publish the Library to npm**:
   - If you want to share your components with others, you can publish your library to npm:
     ```bash
     npm publish dist/my-library
     ```
   - Make sure you’re logged in to npm and have a proper versioning strategy in place.

### **4. Using the Components in Your Angular Application**
1. **Install the Published Library**:
   - In your Angular application, install the library you’ve published:
     ```bash
     npm install my-library
     ```

2. **Import and Use the Component**:
   - Import the component module into your Angular application’s module:
     ```typescript
     import { MyLibraryModule } from 'my-library';

     @NgModule({
       declarations: [AppComponent],
       imports: [BrowserModule, MyLibraryModule],
       bootstrap: [AppComponent],
     })
     export class AppModule {}
     ```
   - Now you can use your `MyButtonComponent` in your Angular application:
     ```html
     <my-button label="Click me"></my-button>
     ```

### **5. Continuous Integration and Automated Testing**
   - Integrate Storybook with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to ensure your components are tested and documented consistently.
   - Use Storybook addons like `@storybook/addon-a11y` for accessibility checks, `@storybook/addon-essentials` for controls, and `@storybook/addon-docs` for autogenerated documentation.

### **6. Documentation and Further Development**
   - Continue adding new components to your Storybook.
   - Document each component’s API, variations, and usage.
   - Explore advanced Storybook features like interactive controls, themes, and custom addons.

### **Learning Resources**
   - [Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/get-started/introduction): Provides detailed guidance on setting up and using Storybook with Angular.
   - [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs): Explore Angular concepts and library creation.

This plan will help you efficiently develop, test, and deploy Angular components using Storybook, allowing for modular, reusable UI development.
